<h3>This is the very first happiness activity on your HEROIC journey, and arguably the most important one!</h3>

That is, you can participate in this activity completely anonymously if you prefer that. If you do choose to reveal any personal details, we promise to only use it for societal benefit, and will not use it to track or identify you. We also promise never to spam you.

<ol>
    <p>You have three options for this activity:</p>
	<li> <a href="/activities/journalingPage">Maintain an online Journal.</a> (We recommend this option because it will enable us to send you a daily reminder.)</li>
